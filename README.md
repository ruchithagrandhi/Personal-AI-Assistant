# Personal-AI-Assistant
The Personal AI Assistant project uses Node MCU, Arduino Nano, a servo motor, and a sound sensor to create a voice-activated system. It detects commands (e.g., "play a song") via the sound sensor, moves the servo to lift cardboard, and sends the command to the Google Assistant API for a speaker response. Designed for reliability, the code ensures synchronized servo and audio feedback, offering hands-on IoT and cybersecurity experience.
Code is available in [assistant_code.ino](assistant_code.ino).
